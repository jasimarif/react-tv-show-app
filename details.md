## Why choose React
Since single page application was required that's why I choose React.
## API of tv shows instead of bandsintown
bandsintown API requires application_id, I requested application id on their website and recieved it on Sunday, at that time I had already finalzied most of the architecture using tv shows API. Both APIs are essentially the same, the only difference is my application shows details of tv show. For example type "Friends" in the search box, all the shows with this keyword will appear, on clicking details button, the route will rerender with the details of that particular show will appear.
## deploy strategy
The application can be deployed on google cloud platform.
